## A packaged application to launch Drupal CMS

A simple, standalone app to run Drupal CMS locally with zero setup.

This installs [Drupal CMS](https://new.drupal.org/drupal-cms) on your machine and opens it in your default browser. The idea is a basic Drupal environment that just works: no fiddly setup process, no Docker, no external dependencies. Simply double-click the app to get started.

This product includes PHP software, freely available from [http://www.php.net/software/](http://www.php.net/software/).

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/drupal/cms-launcher/releases) for your operating system.

The Mac application comes properly signed. If you're on Windows, you'll probably see a security warning. This will go away once the app has the appropriate code signing, which is currently in progress.

This launcher is designed to help you **test out and build a site with Drupal CMS**. It's ideal for site builders, themers, and evaluators who want to explore Drupal CMS quickly.

It is **not intended for contributing to or developing Drupal CMS itself**. If your goal is to work on Drupal CMS core or the upstream project, you should use the [Drupal CMS project on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal_cms).

We use [static-php-cli](https://static-php.dev/) to compile a copy of PHP 8.3 that includes everything needed to run Drupal CMS. We bundle that with the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency manager, and use those two tools to install and serve Drupal CMS. The app itself is a very simple front-end to PHP and Composer, written in JavaScript using the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework.

The Drupal files and database are stored outside of the application, in the *drupal* directory under the user's *Documents* directory. The site uses a lightweight SQLite database, located at `web/sites/default/files/.ht.sqlite`.

To reset your Drupal CMS instance, close the application, delete the *drupal* directory from your *Documents* directory, and launch the application again. It will reinstall Drupal CMS from scratch.

To completely uninstall the Drupal CMS Launcher and remove all associated files:

1. **Delete the application:**
	- On macOS: Move the app from your *Applications* directory to the Trash.
	- On Windows: Delete the application directory you extracted from the ZIP file.
2. **Remove the Drupal files:**
	- Navigate to your *Documents* directory.
	- Delete the *drupal* directory to remove the site files and SQLite database.

After these steps, the application and all its data will be fully removed from your system.

## Sponsorship

This launcher is maintained by the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) and community contributors, but it depends on the amazing `static-php-cli` project, which is used to build the PHP interpreter bundled with the launcher. We heartily encourage you to [sponsor that project's maintainer](https://github.com/sponsors/crazywhalecc) and/or become a Drupal Association member.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (the JavaScript runtime—not the Drupal module 😉)
- PHP 8.3 or later, globally installed
- Composer, globally installed

Clone this repository, then `cd` into it and run:

```
mkdir bin
ln -s -f $(which php) bin
ln -s -f $(which composer) bin/composer.phar
npm install
npm run start
```

To test the full app bundle, run `npm run make` and look for the final binary in the `out` directory.

This launcher is meant to get Drupal CMS up and running with no fuss, but it can't replace a full-featured development environment. Specifically, this launcher:

- Does not support deploying to hosting services (yet).
- Only supports SQLite databases, since SQLite is compiled into the PHP interpreter and has no additional dependencies.
- Uses [the web server built into the PHP interpreter](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php), which is meant for testing and is not as powerful as Apache or nginx.
- Might not be able to send email, since it relies on whatever mail transfer program is (or isn't) on your system.
- Uses PHP 8.3—the minimum required by Drupal 11—for maximum compatibility and performance.

If these limitations don’t meet your needs, consider the following alternatives:

- [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) is Drupal's Docker-based local development platform of choice and gives you everything you need. It even has [a quick-start for Drupal CMS](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal-drupal-cms).
- [Lando](https://lando.dev/) and [Docksal](https://docksal.io/) are also widely used, Docker-based options.
- If you'd rather avoid Docker, [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) is a fine choice.
- [MAMP](http://mamp.info/) is a long-standing favorite among web developers and is worth exploring.
- For Mac users, [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/valet) is great if you're comfortable at the command line.
